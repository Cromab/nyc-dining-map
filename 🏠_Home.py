          This Streamlit application shows an interactive map üó∫Ô∏è of New York City with the ability to dig into individual restaurants history and violations as recorded by the city. This can be viewed in both the form of a heatmap and hierarchical clusters that allow each restaurant to be drilled into. These two views provide a deeper understanding of health trends across the city.
          
          All data is publically available at [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j/about_data). This data is updated on a daily basis, and new entries are pulled in on a daily basis to be appended to our data and mapped accordingly. With this application, you have access to health inspection results as they happen! Think of it like CrimeSpot, but for trying to avoid food poisoning!
